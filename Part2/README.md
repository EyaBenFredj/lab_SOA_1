SOAP enforces strict input/output structure through WSDL (Web Services Description Language). This defines the data types, operations, and expected request/response formats. In contrast, the monolithic script had no formal interface â€” just hardcoded function calls and SQL queries. With SOAP, clients can reliably interact with the service regardless of language or platform, as long as they follow the WSDL contract.
